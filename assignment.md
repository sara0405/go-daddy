# What we'd like you to do:

Please create a simple React application that lists our public GitHub repositories, where clicking one of the repositories in the list takes the user to a page containing additional details about that particular repository. You are welcome to use whatever libraries you'd like, but no need to over-engineer this - a simple solution is entirely appropriate here, we're just looking to get a sense of how you approach the problem and structure your solution.

## Details:

You can get a list of our public repositories via this URL: https://api.github.com/orgs/godaddy/repos
For the additional details page, please display at least the following data about the repository:

- title
- description
- link to the repo on GitHub
- language(s) in the repo
- forks, open issues, watchers

The solution should include some basic tests, bonus points for making it look nice.

Finally, please include a README including the basics of how to install and run your project, and any further information you may want to share with us about it, such as a brief explanation of why you've chosen certain libraries to base your solution on, or anything you may have omitted due to time constraints.
